# Side Quest

### An RPG quest and encounter website Maybe Magazine.

Since the time of Gary Gygax; Dungeon Masters, Games Masters and Story tellers have been searching for quest and encounter ideas.

Even now the Roleplaying table top platform can be played online through sites as Roll20, there is still few small quests and encpunters 

to aid our dungeon masters.

That is where we at **SIDEQUEST** Leap in to provide a teasing snippet now and with your help extend our repitour to provide more quest ideas in the future. 


## UX

### Who is the site for? 

For the owner a Table top Roleplay game Dungeon Master wanting to share quest and Encounter Ideas.

For Table Top Roleplay Game Dungeon Masters, Game Masters and Storytellers.

### What do they want to achieve?

The owner Wants to share their ideas of good quick small quests and encounters and recieve feedback and ideas from the community.

The users want to recieve ideas for quick easy quests and share their own ideas, stories and quests.

### Planning
I started by choosing this idea out of the few that I had using the table points system.

I then used the table points system and choice graph to simplify down to 20 or so pages.

I then took the obviouly good advice of my mentor to simplify down to the 8 pages I now have.

I have provided my wireframe in

plans/side-quest-wireframe.bmpr 

This does not display in the git workspace so Please let me know if I need to provide a different link.
