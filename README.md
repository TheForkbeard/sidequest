6 no. quest pages over 2 platforms

##Planning##
I started by choosing this idea out of the few that I had using the table points system.

I then used the table points system and choice graph to simplify down to 20 or so pages.

I then took the obviouly good advice of my mentor to simplify down to the 8 pages I now have.

I have provided my wireframe in plans/side-quest-wireframe.bmpr 

This does not display in the git workspace so Please let me know if I need to provide a different link.
